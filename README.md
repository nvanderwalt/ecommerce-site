## Subscription Renewal System

This project includes an automated subscription renewal system:

- Subscriptions with `auto_renew` enabled will be automatically renewed when they are about to expire.
- The renewal process is handled by a management command: `python manage.py renew_subscriptions`.
- Expired subscriptions are marked as `EXPIRED` and users are notified by email.
- Users can enable or disable auto-renewal from their subscription management page.

### Setting up automatic renewals

To run the renewal process daily, set up a cron job (Linux/macOS) or a scheduled task (Windows) to run:

```
python manage.py renew_subscriptions
```

### Testing the renewal system

Unit tests for the renewal logic are in `subscriptions/tests/test_renewal.py`:

```
python manage.py test subscriptions.tests.test_renewal
```

### Email notifications

- Users receive an email when their subscription is renewed or expired.
- Make sure to configure `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` in your Django settings.
